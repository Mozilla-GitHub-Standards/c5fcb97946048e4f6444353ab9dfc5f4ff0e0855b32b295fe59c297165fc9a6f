  Before you can submit a game, you'll need to create an account on this
  site. Having an account allows you to come back and modify your
  submission, add new screenshots, etc. We'll also need the e-mail address
  associated with your account to contact you if you win a prize in one of
  the prize categories, or if we need to contact you about your entry for
  any reason.
